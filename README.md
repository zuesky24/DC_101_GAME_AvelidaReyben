Game Name: Memory Match

Description:
Memory Match is a fun single-player game where the player flips two cards at a time to find matching pairs. Each card hides a symbol, and the goal is to remember their positions to match all pairs using the fewest moves possible. If the two flipped cards match, they stay revealed; if not, they flip back and the player tries again.
